## Building Product, Talking to Users and Growing

[YouTube Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/yP176MBG9Tk)


 Lecture is based off of mistakes **HomeJoy**.  A lot of my advice comes from failure and understanding what you shouldn't do and then using that to make generalizations about what you should do.

Just a reminder that you should take all advice as directionally good guidance,

**but every business is different. You're different, and I'm not you, so take everything with that in mind.**


## Advices
 
 When you start a startup you should have : 
  - a lot of time on your hands to concentrate on the startup.
  
  - not saying that you should quit school or quit work; what I'm saying is that you should have a lot of compressed time that is dedicated to immersing yourself in the idea and developing solutions to the problem that you are trying to solve. 
  
   - For example, if you're in school it is better to have one or two days straight per week to work on your idea versus spending two hours here and there every single day during the course of the week. It's like coding.
   
   
### What are the things that most people do incorrectly when starting a startup? 

  > The novice approach is thinking, "I have this really great idea, I don't want to tell anyone about it. I'm going to build and then going to tell one or two people and then launch it then I'm going to get lots of users."

- What really happens is because you did not get a lot of feedback, maybe you get a lot of people to your site, but no one sticks around because you didn't get that initial user feedback.

- If you're lucky enough to have some money in the bank you might go buy some users but it just whittles out over time and you just give up.

- It is sort of a vicious cycle. I actually did this once, and I did this while I was in YC. When I went through YC I didn't even launch a product. I didn't launch on TechCrunch which is the thing you should definitely do. You don't ever want to get into that cycle because you'll just end up with nothing good.

### After this

The next thing is that you have an idea and you should really think about what the idea is really solving.
 - Like what is the actual problem. 
 - You should be able to describe your problem in one sentence. 
 - And then you should think,
   - **"How does that problem relate to me?**
   - **Am I really passionate about that problem?"**
   
 - And then you should think, 
  **"Okay it's a problem I have, but is it a problem that other people have?"**
 
 And you verify that by going out and talking to people.
 
### PathJoy Failure
 
One of the biggest mistakes I've made involves my co-founder.

We started a company called Pathjoy in 2009 or 2010.

Goal of company people really happy, and to create a company that was very, very impactful. 

A good proxy for that is to just create a big huge company. And so we thought, okay, the problem we are solving is to make people happier. We first went to the notion of who are the people who make people happy.

We came up with life coaches and therapists. It seemed kind of obvious to create a platform for life coaches and therapist. What happened as a result was that when we started using the product ourselves, 

we aren't cynical people by any means, but life coaches and therapists are just not people we would use ourselves.
 - It was sort of useless to us.
 - So it wasn't even a problem that we had and it wasn't something that we were super passionate about building out, yet we  spent almost a year trying to do this.
 
 - And so if you just start from T=0 and think about this before you build any product I think you can save yourself a lot of headache down the road from doing something you don't want to do.
 
 
 ### Got Idea
 
So say you have a problem or idea and you are able to state it, 

**where do you start and how do you think of solutions?**

The first thing you should do is think about the industry that you are getting yourself into.
Whether it is big or whether it is huge, you should really immerse (involve) yourself in that industry. 
And there are a number of ways to do this. below are explained.

### Ways to Start

One is to really become a cog in that industry for a little bit. And so it might seem a little counterintuitive to do this because most people say that if you really want to disrupt an industry you should really not be a player in it.

Someone who spent 20 or 30 years in an industry is probably set in their ways and is just used to the way things work and really can't think about what the inefficiencies are or the things that you can "disrupt".

- However, as a newbie coming into the industry you really should take **one or two months** to just really understand what all of the little bits and pieces of the industry are and how it works.

Because it's when you get into the details, that's when you start seeing things that you can be exploiting and things that are really inefficient and may provide a huge overhead cost that you may be able to cut down.

### Example of HomeJoy

This is that when we started Homejoy, 
 - we started with the cleaning industry, 
  - and when we started we were the cleaners ourselves.
  - We started to clean houses and we found out really quickly that we were very bad cleaners.
  - As a result, we said okay, we have to learn more about this and we went to buy books. We bought books about how to clean, which helped maybe a little bit.
  - We learned a little more about cleaning supplies but it is sort of like basketball, you can read and learn about basketball but you're not going to get better at it if you don't actually train and throw a basketball into the net.
