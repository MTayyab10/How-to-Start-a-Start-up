## Building Product, Talking to Users and Growing

[YouTube Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/yP176MBG9Tk)


 Lecture is based off of mistakes **HomeJoy**.  A lot of my advice comes from failure and understanding what you shouldn't do and then using that to make generalizations about what you should do.

Just a reminder that you should take all advice as directionally good guidance,

**but every business is different. You're different, So take everything with that in mind.**


## Advices
 
 When you start a startup you should have : 
  - a lot of time on your hands to concentrate on the startup.
  
  - not saying that you should quit school or quit work; what I'm saying is that you should have a lot of compressed time that is dedicated to immersing yourself in the idea and developing solutions to the problem that you are trying to solve. 
  
   - For example, if you're in school it is better to have one or two days straight per week to work on your idea versus spending two hours here and there every single day during the course of the week. It's like coding.
   
   
### What are the things that most people do incorrectly when starting a startup? 

  > The novice approach is thinking, "I have this really great idea, I don't want to tell anyone about it. I'm going to build and then going to tell one or two people and then launch it then I'm going to get lots of users."

- What really happens is because you did not get a lot of feedback, maybe you get a lot of people to your site, but no one sticks around because you didn't get that initial user feedback.

- If you're lucky enough to have some money in the bank you might go buy some users but it just whittles out over time and you just give up.

- It is sort of a vicious cycle. I actually did this once, and I did this while I was in YC. When I went through YC I didn't even launch a product. I didn't launch on TechCrunch which is the thing you should definitely do. You don't ever want to get into that cycle because you'll just end up with nothing good.

## After this

The next thing is that you have an idea and you should really think about what the idea is really solving.
 - Like what is the actual problem. 
 - You should be able to describe your problem in one sentence. 
 - And then you should think,
   - **"How does that problem relate to me?**
   - **Am I really passionate about that problem?"**
   
 - And then you should think, 
  **"Okay it's a problem I have, but is it a problem that other people have?"**
 
 And you verify that by going out and talking to people.
 
## PathJoy Failure
 
One of the biggest mistakes I've made involves my co-founder.

We started a company called Pathjoy in 2009 or 2010.

Goal of company people really happy, and to create a company that was very, very impactful. 

A good proxy for that is to just create a big huge company. And so we thought, okay, the problem we are solving is to make people happier. We first went to the notion of who are the people who make people happy.

We came up with life coaches and therapists. It seemed kind of obvious to create a platform for life coaches and therapist. What happened as a result was that when we started using the product ourselves, 

we aren't cynical people by any means, but life coaches and therapists are just not people we would use ourselves.
 - It was sort of useless to us.
 - So it wasn't even a problem that we had and it wasn't something that we were super passionate about building out, yet we  spent almost a year trying to do this.
 
 - And so if you just start from T=0 and think about this before you build any product I think you can save yourself a lot of headache down the road from doing something you don't want to do.
 
 
## Got Idea
 
So say you have a problem or idea and you are able to state it, 

**where do you start and how do you think of solutions?**

The first thing you should do is think about the industry that you are getting yourself into.
Whether it is big or whether it is huge, you should really immerse (involve) yourself in that industry. 
And there are a number of ways to do this. below are explained.

### Ways to Start

One is to really become a cog in that industry for a little bit. And so it might seem a little counterintuitive to do this because most people say that if you really want to disrupt an industry you should really not be a player in it.

Someone who spent 20 or 30 years in an industry is probably set in their ways and is just used to the way things work and really can't think about what the inefficiencies are or the things that you can "disrupt".

- However, as a newbie coming into the industry you really should take **one or two months** to just really understand what all of the little bits and pieces of the industry are and how it works.

Because it's when you get into the details, that's when you start seeing things that you can be exploiting and things that are really inefficient and may provide a huge overhead cost that you may be able to cut down.

### Example of HomeJoy

This is that when we started Homejoy, 

  - we started with the cleaning industry, 
  - and when we started we were the cleaners ourselves.
  - We started to clean houses and we found out really quickly that we were very bad cleaners.
  - As a result, we said okay, we have to learn more about this and we went to buy books. We bought books about how to clean, which helped maybe a little bit.
  - We learned a little more about cleaning supplies but it is sort of like basketball, you can read and learn about basketball but you're not going to get better at it if you don't actually train and throw a basketball into the net.
  
> So one of us was going to have to learn how to clean. Or at least get trained by a professional. We actually went to get a job at a cleaning company itself and I learned a lot about cleaning.

I learned a lot about how a local cleaning company works. 
In that sense I learned why a local cleaning company could not become huge like Homejoy is today. 

- And that is because they are pretty old school and they have a lot of things that are done inefficiently. Such as booking the customer and optimizing the cleaners' schedules was just done very inefficiently.  

### Note 

If you are in a situation like mine where there is a service element of it then you should go and do that service yourself.

If your thing is related to restaurants you should become a waiter, if it is related to painting become a painter and kind of get in the shoes of your customers from all angles of what you are trying to build.

The other thing is there is also a level of obsessiveness that you should have with it as well. You should be so obsessed that you want to know what everybody in that space is doing.

- And it is things like writing a list of all 
 - of the potential competitors,
 - similar types of companies, 

- Google searching them and clicking on every single link and reading every single article from search result number 1 to 1000.

- You should become an expert in your industry. There should be no doubt when you are building this that you are the expert so that people trust you when you are building this product.


The second thing is identifying **customer segments**.

Ideally at the end of the day you have built a product or business that everybody in the world is using.

In the beginning, you realistically want to corner off a certain part of the customer base so that you can really optimize for them.

It is just about focus and whether you are catering to teenage girls or whether it is soccer moms, you will be able to focus a lot on their needs.


### Important

And lastly, before you even create a product or before you put code down.

> You should really storyboard out the user experience of how you are going to solve the problem.
And that is not just meaning the website itself?
> - It also means how does the customer find out about you.
  > - It can be through an ad or word-of-mouth, and
  > - then they come to your site and they learn more about you.
 
 - What does that text say and what are you communicating to them when they sign up for the project and when they purchase the service? 
 - What are they actually getting from your service or product? 
 
 - After they finish using the product or service do they leave a review or do they leave comments? 
 
 **You need to be able to go through that whole flow and visualize in your head what the perfect user experience is.**
 
 **And then put it down on paper and put it into code, and then start from there.**
 
 
 So, you have all these ideas in your head, 
 
 - Now you kind of know what the core customer base is that you want to go after,
 
 - And you know everything about the industry, what do you do next?
 
 - You start building your product. The common phrase that most people use today is, 
 
 - You should build a "minimum viable product (MVP)." And I underlined viable because I think a lot of people skip that part and they go out with a feature and the whole user experience in the very beginning is flat.
 
 - Minimal viable product pretty much means what is the smallest feature set that you should build to solve the problem that you are trying to solve. 
 
 - I think if you go through the whole storyboarding experience you can kind of figure that out very quickly. But again, you have to be talking to users, you have to be seeing what exists out there already, and what you should be building should solve their immediate needs.
 
 ### Second Thing
 
>   > And the second thing is that before you put things in front of the user you should really have your product positioning down. 
  > What I mean by that is that you should be able to go to a person and be able to say, "Hey, this does X,Y, and Z in one sentence." 
  - So for example, at Homejoy we started off with something super complicated. We were an online platform for home services, you start with cleaning and you can choose blah blah blah. It just went on for paragraphs and paragraphs.
 
 When we went to potential users to come on our platform they would kind of get bored after the first few sentences. 
 
 **What we found out was that we needed a one-liner. The one-liner was very important.**
 
 It kind of describes the functional benefits of what you do. In the future when you are trying to build a brand or whatnot you should be able to describe the emotional benefits and stuff like that. 
 
But when you are starting with no users you really need to tell them what they are going to get out of it.

After we changed our position to get your place cleaned for $20 an hour, then everyone got it and we were able to get users in the door that way.

### After MVP ( Minimum Viable Product )

So you have an MVP out there:
- now how do you get your first few users to start trying it? 

- The first few users should be obviously people you are connected with.

You and your cofounder should be using it, your mom and dad should be using it, and your friends and coworkers should be using it.

- Beyond that, you want to get more user feedback. 
I've listed here some of the obvious places to go to depending on what you are selling. You can take your pick of the draw here. 
 - So, online communities, on Hacker News now there is the show HN - that's a great place.
 - Especially if you are building tools for developers and things like that.
 
 - Local communities - so if you're building consumer products you know there are a lot of influential local community mailing lists. Especially those for parents. Those are places you might want to hit up too.

### Example 

At Homejoy we actually tried all of these. We used it ourselves and that was fine. We were the only cleaners so that was pretty easy.

Our parents live in Milwaukee and we were based in Mountain View so that didn't work. Friends and coworkers were kind of like in San Francisco and elsewhere so we didn't have too many of them use it.

- So we actually ended up in a dead end of not being able to convince many people to use it in the beginning. So what we did was, because we are in Mountain View, some of you guys might know on Castro Street they have street fairs there during the summertime. 

- So we would go out and basically chase down people and get them to try to book a cleaning. Almost everyone would say no until one day we just took advantage of the weather. It was a very hot and humid day and what we noticed was that everyone gravitated towards the food and drink area, especially on a hot day.

We figured we needed to get in the middle of that so we took water bottles and froze them and we started handing out free bottles of water that were cold.

- And people just came to us. I think we basically guilt tripped people into booking cleanings. But the proof in the pudding was that I figured most of the people were guilt tripped into doing it, but then they went home and they didn't cancel on us. Well, some of them did but the majority of them did not. I thought that's good, I have to go clean their houses but at least there is something we are actually solving here.


### Do like this

I know another startup in the last batch, I forgot their name right now, but they were selling shipping type products or trying to replace shipping products.

- So they would show up to the US postal office and find people who were trying to ship products and just take them out of line and get them to try to use the product and have them ship it for them. So you just have to go to places where people are really going to show up.

- Your conversion rate is going to be really low but to go from 0 to 1 to 3 to 4 these are the kind of things you might have to do.

### After having few Users

So now that you have users using you ,

 - **what do you do with all of these users?** 
 
The first thing you should do is make sure that there is a way for people to contact you. 

Ideally there is a phone number and if you put up a phone number, one good idea is to make sure that you have a voicemail so that you won't be picking it up all the time. 

But in any case a way for people to give inbound feedback is good, but really what you should be doing is going out to your users and talking to them.

- Get away from your desk and just get out and do the work. It seems like a slog and it is going to be a slog but this is where you are going to get the best feedback ever for your product.

- And this is where it is going to teach you what features you need to completely change, get rid of, or what features you need to build.

### Do Surveys

One way to do this is to send out surveys to get reviews after they have used the product. This is okay but generally people are only going to respond if they really love you or they really hate you. And you never get the in between.

- A way to get the in between and not all of the extremes is to actually meet the person that is using your product. I've seen people go out to meet the user and they sit there and it is like a laboratory and it is like an inquisition. You're just kind of poking at them. That is not going to give you the best results.

- What you should really do is make it into a conversation and get to know them and get them to feel comfortable. You want to get them at a level where they feel like they should be honest with you to help you improve things.

- So I found that actually **taking people out for drinks and stuff** like that was actually a very good way to do that. I'm not sure if all of you are old enough to do that but you can take them for coffee.

### Customer Retention

So another thing that you should be tracking is how are you doing in general from a macro perspective. The best way to do that is by tracking customer retention. The number of people that came in the door today, the number of people who are coming back tomorrow, the next day and so forth. 

Usually over time you are kind of looking at monthly retention so people who came in the door today, are they still using it next month and so forth.

The problem with that metric is that it takes forever to collect that data and sometimes you don't have a month or two months or three months to figure that out. 

So a good leading indicator is actually collecting reviews and ratings. Such as five-star and four-star reviews or collecting some notion of nps, which is net promoter score.
So you're basically asking them for a rating from 0 to 10 about how likely are they to recommend you to a friend and calculating the nps.

Over time what you'll see is that as you are building new features, you will be able to see that the reviews and the retention are going up over time. That means that you are doing a good job.

If it is going down then you are doing a bad job. If it is kind of staying the same that probably means that you need to go out and figure out what new things you should be building.
