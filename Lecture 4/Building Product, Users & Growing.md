## Building Product, Talking to Users and Growing

[YouTube Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/yP176MBG9Tk)


 Lecture is based off of mistakes **HomeJoy**.  A lot of my advice comes from failure and understanding what you shouldn't do and then using that to make generalizations about what you should do.

Just a reminder that you should take all advice as directionally good guidance,

**but every business is different. You're different, So take everything with that in mind.**


## Advices
 
 When you start a startup you should have : 
  - a lot of time on your hands to concentrate on the startup.
  
  - not saying that you should quit school or quit work; what I'm saying is that you should have a lot of compressed time that is dedicated to immersing yourself in the idea and developing solutions to the problem that you are trying to solve. 
  
   - For example, if you're in school it is better to have one or two days straight per week to work on your idea versus spending two hours here and there every single day during the course of the week. It's like coding.
   
   
### What are the things that most people do incorrectly when starting a startup? 

  > The novice approach is thinking, "I have this really great idea, I don't want to tell anyone about it. I'm going to build and then going to tell one or two people and then launch it then I'm going to get lots of users."

- What really happens is because you did not get a lot of feedback, maybe you get a lot of people to your site, but no one sticks around because you didn't get that initial user feedback.

- If you're lucky enough to have some money in the bank you might go buy some users but it just whittles out over time and you just give up.

- It is sort of a vicious cycle. I actually did this once, and I did this while I was in YC. When I went through YC I didn't even launch a product. I didn't launch on TechCrunch which is the thing you should definitely do. You don't ever want to get into that cycle because you'll just end up with nothing good.

## After this

The next thing is that you have an idea and you should really think about what the idea is really solving.
 - Like what is the actual problem. 
 - You should be able to describe your problem in one sentence. 
 - And then you should think,
   - **"How does that problem relate to me?**
   - **Am I really passionate about that problem?"**
   
 - And then you should think, 
  **"Okay it's a problem I have, but is it a problem that other people have?"**
 
 And you verify that by going out and talking to people.
 
## PathJoy Failure
 
One of the biggest mistakes I've made involves my co-founder.

We started a company called Pathjoy in 2009 or 2010.

Goal of company people really happy, and to create a company that was very, very impactful. 

A good proxy for that is to just create a big huge company. And so we thought, okay, the problem we are solving is to make people happier. We first went to the notion of who are the people who make people happy.

We came up with life coaches and therapists. It seemed kind of obvious to create a platform for life coaches and therapist. What happened as a result was that when we started using the product ourselves, 

we aren't cynical people by any means, but life coaches and therapists are just not people we would use ourselves.
 - It was sort of useless to us.
 - So it wasn't even a problem that we had and it wasn't something that we were super passionate about building out, yet we  spent almost a year trying to do this.
 
 - And so if you just start from T=0 and think about this before you build any product I think you can save yourself a lot of headache down the road from doing something you don't want to do.
 
 
## Got Idea
 
So say you have a problem or idea and you are able to state it, 

**where do you start and how do you think of solutions?**

The first thing you should do is think about the industry that you are getting yourself into.
Whether it is big or whether it is huge, you should really immerse (involve) yourself in that industry. 
And there are a number of ways to do this. below are explained.

### Ways to Start

One is to really become a cog in that industry for a little bit. And so it might seem a little counterintuitive to do this because most people say that if you really want to disrupt an industry you should really not be a player in it.

Someone who spent 20 or 30 years in an industry is probably set in their ways and is just used to the way things work and really can't think about what the inefficiencies are or the things that you can "disrupt".

- However, as a newbie coming into the industry you really should take **one or two months** to just really understand what all of the little bits and pieces of the industry are and how it works.

Because it's when you get into the details, that's when you start seeing things that you can be exploiting and things that are really inefficient and may provide a huge overhead cost that you may be able to cut down.

### Example of HomeJoy

This is that when we started Homejoy, 

  - we started with the cleaning industry, 
  - and when we started we were the cleaners ourselves.
  - We started to clean houses and we found out really quickly that we were very bad cleaners.
  - As a result, we said okay, we have to learn more about this and we went to buy books. We bought books about how to clean, which helped maybe a little bit.
  - We learned a little more about cleaning supplies but it is sort of like basketball, you can read and learn about basketball but you're not going to get better at it if you don't actually train and throw a basketball into the net.
  
> So one of us was going to have to learn how to clean. Or at least get trained by a professional. We actually went to get a job at a cleaning company itself and I learned a lot about cleaning.

I learned a lot about how a local cleaning company works. 
In that sense I learned why a local cleaning company could not become huge like Homejoy is today. 

- And that is because they are pretty old school and they have a lot of things that are done inefficiently. Such as booking the customer and optimizing the cleaners' schedules was just done very inefficiently.  

### Note 

If you are in a situation like mine where there is a service element of it then you should go and do that service yourself.

If your thing is related to restaurants you should become a waiter, if it is related to painting become a painter and kind of get in the shoes of your customers from all angles of what you are trying to build.

The other thing is there is also a level of obsessiveness that you should have with it as well. You should be so obsessed that you want to know what everybody in that space is doing.

- And it is things like writing a list of all 
 - of the potential competitors,
 - similar types of companies, 

- Google searching them and clicking on every single link and reading every single article from search result number 1 to 1000.

- You should become an expert in your industry. There should be no doubt when you are building this that you are the expert so that people trust you when you are building this product.


The second thing is identifying **customer segments**.

Ideally at the end of the day you have built a product or business that everybody in the world is using.

In the beginning, you realistically want to corner off a certain part of the customer base so that you can really optimize for them.

It is just about focus and whether you are catering to teenage girls or whether it is soccer moms, you will be able to focus a lot on their needs.


### Important

And lastly, before you even create a product or before you put code down.

> You should really storyboard out the user experience of how you are going to solve the problem.
And that is not just meaning the website itself?
> - It also means how does the customer find out about you.
  > - It can be through an ad or word-of-mouth, and
  > - then they come to your site and they learn more about you.
 
 - What does that text say and what are you communicating to them when they sign up for the project and when they purchase the service? 
 - What are they actually getting from your service or product? 
 
 - After they finish using the product or service do they leave a review or do they leave comments? 
 
 You need to be able to go through that whole flow and visualize in your head what the perfect user experience is. And then put it down on paper and put it into code, and then start from there.
