## Building Product, Talking to Users and Growing

[YouTube Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/yP176MBG9Tk)


 Lecture is based off of mistakes **HomeJoy**.  A lot of my advice comes from failure and understanding what you shouldn't do and then using that to make generalizations about what you should do.

**Just a reminder that you should take all advice as directionally good guidance, but every business is different. You're different, and I'm not you, so take everything with that in mind.**


## Advices
 
 When you start a startup you should have : 
  - a lot of time on your hands to concentrate on the startup.
  
  - not saying that you should quit school or quit work; what I'm saying is that you should have a lot of compressed time that is dedicated to immersing yourself in the idea and developing solutions to the problem that you are trying to solve. 
  
   - For example, if you're in school it is better to have one or two days straight per week to work on your idea versus spending two hours here and there every single day during the course of the week. It's like coding.
   
   
### what are the things that most people do incorrectly when starting a startup? 

    The novice approach is thinking, "I have this really great idea, I don't want to tell anyone about it. I'm going to build, build, build and then going to maybe tell one or two people and then I'm going to launch it then I'm going to get lots of users."

- What really happens is because you did not get a lot of feedback, maybe you get a lot of people to your site, but no one sticks around because you didn't get that initial user feedback.

- If you're lucky enough to have some money in the bank you might go buy some users but it just whittles out over time and you just give up.

- It is sort of a vicious cycle. I actually did this once, and I did this while I was in YC. When I went through YC I didn't even launch a product. I didn't launch on TechCrunch which is the thing you should definitely do. You don't ever want to get into that cycle because you'll just end up with nothing good.

### After this

The next thing is that you have an idea and you should really think about what the idea is really solving.
 - Like what is the actual problem. 
 - You should be able to describe your problem in one sentence. 
 - And then you should think,
   - **"How does that problem relate to me?**
   - **Am I really passionate about that problem?"**
 - And then you should think, \
  **"Okay it's a problem I have, but is it a problem that other people have?"**
 
 And you verify that by going out and talking to people.
