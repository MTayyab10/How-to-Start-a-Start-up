# Business strategy and monopoly ( Competition is For Losers)

[YouTube Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/5_0dVHMpJlo)


> I'm completely obsessed with on the business side which is that 
if you’re the founder, entrepreneur, starting a company you always want to aim for monopoly and you want to always avoid competition.
And so hence competition is for losers, something we’ll be talking about today.

## Capturing Value

I'd like to start by saying something about the basic idea of when you start one of these companies,
how do you go about creating value? What makes a business valuable? And I want to suggest there's basically a very simple formula, that if you have a valuable company two things are true. Number one, that it creates "X" dollars of value for the world. Number two, that you capture "Y" percent of "X.” And the critical thing that I think people always miss in this sort of analysis is that "X" and "Y" are completely independent variables, and so "X" can be very big and "Y" can be very small. "X" can be an intermediate size and if "Y” is reasonably big, you can still have a very big business.
