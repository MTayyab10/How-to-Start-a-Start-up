# Business strategy and create monopoly

[YouTube Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/5_0dVHMpJlo)


> I'm completely obsessed with on the business side which is that 
if you’re the founder, entrepreneur, starting a company you always want to aim for monopoly and you want to always avoid competition.

And so hence competition is for losers, something we’ll be talking about today.

## Capturing Value

Basic idea of when you start one of these companies,

**how do you go about creating value? What makes a business valuable?**

A very simple formula, that if you have a valuable company two things are true. 

- Number one, that it creates "X" dollars of value for the world.
- Number two, that you capture "Y" percent of "X.” And the critical thing that I think people always miss in this sort of analysis is that "X" and "Y" are completely independent variables, and so "X" can be very big and "Y" can be very small. "X" can be an intermediate size and if "Y” is reasonably big, you can still have a very big business.


> **So to create a valuable company you have to basically both create something of value and capture some fraction of the value of what you've created.**

## Perfect Competition

If we look at perfect competition, 

there's some pros and cons to the world of perfect competition. On a high level, this is something you always study in Econ I, it's always easy to model, which is why I think econ professors like talking about perfect competition. 

It somehow is efficient, especially in a world where things are static, because you have all the consumer surplus that’s captured by everybody, and politically it’s what we’re told is good in our society: you want to have competition and it’s somehow a good thing. 

Of course there are a lot of negatives, it's generally not that good if you're involved in anything that’s hyper competitive, because you often don't make money.

So I think on one end of the spectrum you have industries that are perfectly competitive and at the other end of the spectrum you have things that I would say are **monopolies**, 

and they’re much more stable longer term businesses, you have more capital, and if you get a creative monopoly for inventing something new, I think it's symptomatic of having created something really valuable.


I do think the extreme binary view of the world is that there are exactly two kinds of businesses in this world, there are businesses that are **perfectly competitive and there monopolies.** 

There is shockingly little that is in between. And this dichotomy is not understood very well because people are constantly lying about the nature of the businesses they are in.

And in my mind this is not necessarily the most important thing in business, but I think it's the most important business idea that people don't understand, that there are just these two kinds of businesses.

## Lies people tell

So let me tell you a little bit about the lies people tell. 

If you imagine that there was a spectrum of companies from perfect competition to monopoly, the apparent differences are quite small because the people who have monopolies pretend not to.

They will basically say, and it’s because you don’t want to get regulated by the government, you don’t want the government to come after you, so you will never say that you have a monopoly.

So anyone who has a monopoly will pretend that they are in incredible competition; and on the other end of the spectrum if you are incredibly competitive, and if you’re in some sort of business where you will never make any money, you'll be tempted to tell a lie that goes in the other direction,

where you will say that you're doing something unique that is somehow less competitive than it looks because you'll want to differentiate, you will want to try and attract capital, or something like that.

**So if the monopolists pretend not to have monopolies, the non-monopolies pretend to have monopolies, the apparent difference is very small whereas the real difference I would submit is actually quite big.**

So there’s this business distortion that happens because of the lies people tell about their businesses and the lies are sort of in these opposite directions.

So the basic lie you tell as a non-monopoly is that we're in a very small market. The basic lie you tell as a monopoly is the market you’re in is much bigger than it looks.

So typically if you want to think of this in set theoretic terms, you could say that a monopoly tells a lie where you describe your business as the union of these vastly different markets and the non-monopolist describes it as the intersection.

So in effect, if you're a non-monopolist you will rhetorically describe your market as super small, you're the only person in that market. If you have a monopoly you'll describe it as super big and there's lots of competition in it.


### Example

I always use restaurants as the example of a terrible business, this is always sort of the idea that capital and competition are antonyms. 

If someone accumulates capital, a world of perfect competition is a world where all the capital gets competed away.
So you're opening a restaurant business, no one wants to invest because you just lose money, so you have to tell some idiosyncratic narrative and you'll say something like. "Well we're the only British food restaurant in Palo Alto.”

So its British, Palo Alto and of course that's too small a market because people may be able to drive all the way to Mountain View or even Menlo Park and there probably are no people who eat nothing but British food, at least no people who are still alive.

So you always have this question about **is the intersection real? Does it make sense? Does it have value?**

And of course there are startup versions of this, and in the really bad versions you just take a whole series of the buzzwords: sharing, mobile, social apps, you combine them and give some kind of narrative and whether or not that's a real business or not, it is generally a bad sign.

It's almost this pattern recognition when you have this rhetoric of these sort of intersections, it generally does not work. The something of somewhere is really mostly just the nothing of nowhere, it's like the Stanford of North Dakota, one of a kind, but it's not Stanford.


Let's look at the opposite, the opposite lie, is if you are let's say the search company that’s down the street from here and has about a happy sixty-six percent market share and is completely dominant in the search market. 

Google almost never describes itself as a search engine these days and instead it describes itself in all these different ways. So it sometimes says it’s an advertising company.

So if it was search you would say, well it's like it has this huge market share that's really crazy, so it's like an incredible monopoly, it's a much bigger and much more robust monopoly than Microsoft ever had in the nineties, maybe that's why it’s making so much money.

Or if you don't want to be an advertising company, you could always say you’re a technology company. The technology market is something like a one trillion dollar market 

and the narrative that you tell about Google and the technology market is, 

> well we're competing with all the car companies with our self-driving cars, we’re competing with Apple on TVs and iPhones, we’re competing with Facebook, we’re competing with Microsoft on office products, we’re competing with Amazon on cloud services and so we're in this giant technology market,

where there's competition in every direction you look and no we’re not the monopoly the government's looking for.

So I think one has to always be super aware that there are these very powerful incentives to distort the nature of these markets, one way or the other.
