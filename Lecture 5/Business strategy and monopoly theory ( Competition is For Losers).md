# Business strategy and create monopoly

[YouTube Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/5_0dVHMpJlo)


> I'm completely obsessed with on the business side which is that 
if you’re the founder, entrepreneur, starting a company you always want to aim for monopoly and you want to always avoid competition.

And so hence competition is for losers, something we’ll be talking about today.

## Capturing Value

Basic idea of when you start one of these companies,

**how do you go about creating value? What makes a business valuable?**

A very simple formula, that if you have a valuable company two things are true. 

- Number one, that it creates "X" dollars of value for the world.
- Number two, that you capture "Y" percent of "X.” And the critical thing that I think people always miss in this sort of analysis is that "X" and "Y" are completely independent variables, and so "X" can be very big and "Y" can be very small. "X" can be an intermediate size and if "Y” is reasonably big, you can still have a very big business.


> **So to create a valuable company you have to basically both create something of value and capture some fraction of the value of what you've created.**

## Perfect Competition

If we look at perfect competition, 

there's some pros and cons to the world of perfect competition. On a high level, this is something you always study in Econ I, it's always easy to model, which is why I think econ professors like talking about perfect competition. 

It somehow is efficient, especially in a world where things are static, because you have all the consumer surplus that’s captured by everybody, and politically it’s what we’re told is good in our society: you want to have competition and it’s somehow a good thing. 

Of course there are a lot of negatives, it's generally not that good if you're involved in anything that’s hyper competitive, because you often don't make money.

So I think on one end of the spectrum you have industries that are perfectly competitive and at the other end of the spectrum you have things that I would say are **monopolies**, 

and they’re much more stable longer term businesses, you have more capital, and if you get a creative monopoly for inventing something new, I think it's symptomatic of having created something really valuable.


I do think the extreme binary view of the world is that there are exactly two kinds of businesses in this world, there are businesses that are **perfectly competitive and there monopolies.** 

There is shockingly little that is in between. And this dichotomy is not understood very well because people are constantly lying about the nature of the businesses they are in.

And in my mind this is not necessarily the most important thing in business, but I think it's the most important business idea that people don't understand, that there are just these two kinds of businesses.

## Lies people tell

So let me tell you a little bit about the lies people tell. 

If you imagine that there was a spectrum of companies from perfect competition to monopoly, the apparent differences are quite small because the people who have monopolies pretend not to.

They will basically say, and it’s because you don’t want to get regulated by the government, you don’t want the government to come after you, so you will never say that you have a monopoly.

So anyone who has a monopoly will pretend that they are in incredible competition; and on the other end of the spectrum if you are incredibly competitive, and if you’re in some sort of business where you will never make any money, you'll be tempted to tell a lie that goes in the other direction,

where you will say that you're doing something unique that is somehow less competitive than it looks because you'll want to differentiate, you will want to try and attract capital, or something like that.

**So if the monopolists pretend not to have monopolies, the non-monopolies pretend to have monopolies, the apparent difference is very small whereas the real difference I would submit is actually quite big.**

So there’s this business distortion that happens because of the lies people tell about their businesses and the lies are sort of in these opposite directions.

So the basic lie you tell as a non-monopoly is that we're in a very small market. The basic lie you tell as a monopoly is the market you’re in is much bigger than it looks.

So typically if you want to think of this in set theoretic terms, you could say that a monopoly tells a lie where you describe your business as the union of these vastly different markets and the non-monopolist describes it as the intersection.

So in effect, if you're a non-monopolist you will rhetorically describe your market as super small, you're the only person in that market. If you have a monopoly you'll describe it as super big and there's lots of competition in it.


### Examples

I always use restaurants as the example of a terrible business, this is always sort of the idea that capital and competition are antonyms. 

If someone accumulates capital, a world of perfect competition is a world where all the capital gets competed away.
So you're opening a restaurant business, no one wants to invest because you just lose money, so you have to tell some idiosyncratic narrative and you'll say something like. "Well we're the only British food restaurant in Palo Alto.”

So its British, Palo Alto and of course that's too small a market because people may be able to drive all the way to Mountain View or even Menlo Park and there probably are no people who eat nothing but British food, at least no people who are still alive.

So you always have this question about **is the intersection real? Does it make sense? Does it have value?**

And of course there are startup versions of this, and in the really bad versions you just take a whole series of the buzzwords: sharing, mobile, social apps, you combine them and give some kind of narrative and whether or not that's a real business or not, it is generally a bad sign.

It's almost this pattern recognition when you have this rhetoric of these sort of intersections, it generally does not work. The something of somewhere is really mostly just the nothing of nowhere, it's like the Stanford of North Dakota, one of a kind, but it's not Stanford.


Let's look at the opposite, the opposite lie, is if you are let's say the search company that’s down the street from here and has about a happy sixty-six percent market share and is completely dominant in the search market. 

Google almost never describes itself as a search engine these days and instead it describes itself in all these different ways. So it sometimes says it’s an advertising company.

So if it was search you would say, well it's like it has this huge market share that's really crazy, so it's like an incredible monopoly, it's a much bigger and much more robust monopoly than Microsoft ever had in the nineties, maybe that's why it’s making so much money.

Or if you don't want to be an advertising company, you could always say you’re a technology company. The technology market is something like a one trillion dollar market 

and the narrative that you tell about Google and the technology market is, 

> well we're competing with all the car companies with our self-driving cars, we’re competing with Apple on TVs and iPhones, we’re competing with Facebook, we’re competing with Microsoft on office products, we’re competing with Amazon on cloud services and so we're in this giant technology market,

where there's competition in every direction you look and no we’re not the monopoly the government's looking for.

So I think one has to always be super aware that there are these very powerful incentives to distort the nature of these markets, one way or the other.

The evidence of narrow markets in the tech industry is if you basically just, 

- if you look at sort of the big tech companies,
  - Apple, 
  - Google, 
  - Microsoft,
  - Amazon, 

- they have just been building up cash for year after year and you have these incredibly high profit margins, and one of the reasons the tech industry in the US has been so successful financially is because it's creating  monopoly-like businesses

and it's reflected by the fact that these companies just accumulate so much cash they don't even know what to do with it beyond a certain point.

### how to build monopoly

Let me say a few things about how to build a monopoly, 

- I think one of the sort of very counterintuitive ideas that comes out of this monopoly thread is that you want to go after small markets.

- If you’re a startup, you want to get to monopoly. You’re starting a new company, you want to get to monopoly.

- Monopolies have a large share of the market, how do you get to a large share of the market? 

You start with a really small market and you take over the whole market and then over time you find ways to expand that market in concentric circles.

### Mistake

The thing that's always a big mistake is going after a giant market on day one because that's typically evidence that you somehow haven't defined categories correctly,

- that normally means there is going to be too much competition in one way or another, so I think almost all the successful companies in Silicon Valley had some model of starting with small markets and expanding.

#### Amazon

- If you take Amazon, you start with just a bookstore, we have all the books in the world, it's a better bookstore than anybody else has in the world when it starts in the 1990s.

It's online, there's things you can do that you could not do before, and then you gradually expand into all sorts of different forms of e-commerce and other things beyond that.

#### eBay

eBay, you start with Pez dispensers, you move on to Beanie Babies, and eventually it’s all these different online auctions for all these sorts of different goods.

What’s very counterintuitive about many of these companies is they often start with markets that are so small, that people don't think they are valuable at all when you get started. 

The PayPal version of this was we started with power sellers on Ebay, which was about twenty thousand people. 

When we first saw this happening in December of 1999, January 2000 right after we launched, there was a sense that these were all, it was such a small market, it was terrible, we thought these were terrible customers to have, it's just people selling junk on the internet, 

**why in the world we want to be going after this market?**

But there was a way to get a product that was much better for everybody in that market, and we got to something like twenty five, thirty percent market penetration in two or three months, and you've got some walk in to brand recognition, and are able to build the business from there.

So I always think these very small markets are quite underrated. 

The Facebook version of this I always give is that if the initial market at Facebook was ten thousand people at Harvard, it went from zero to sixty percent market share in ten days, that was a very auspicious start.

The way this gets analyzed in business schools is always, that's so ridiculous, it's such a small market, it can't have any value at all.

So I think the business school analysis of **Facebook early on, or of Paypal early on, or of Ebay early on**, is that the markets were perhaps so small as to have almost no value and that they would've had little value had they they stayed small,

but it turned out there were ways to grow them concentrically and that's what made them so valuable.

Now I think the opposite version of this is always where you have super big markets and there is so many different things that went wrong with all the clean tech companies in the last decade. 

But the one theme than ran through almost all of them is that they all started with massive markets.

Every clean tech powerpoint presentation that one saw in the years 2005 to 2008, which is the clean tech bubble in Silicon Valley, started with where the energy market, where the market was measured in hundreds and billions of trillions of dollars.

**And then once you're sort of like a minnow in a vast ocean, that is not a good place to be. That means you have tons of competitors and you don’t even know who all the competitors are.**

- You want to be a one of a kind company. You want to be the only player in a small ecosystem.

- You don’t want to be the fourth online pet food company. 
- You don’t want to be the tenth solar panel company. 
- You don’t want to be the hundredth restaurant in Palo Alto. 

- Your restaurant industry is a trillion dollar industry. So if you do a market size analysis, you conclude restaurants are fantastic business to go into.

And often large existing markets typically means that you have tons of competitions so it's very very hard to differentiate.

- The **first very counterintuitive idea is to go after small markets,** markets that are so small people often don't even think that they make sense.

- That's where you get a foothold and then if those markets are able expand, you can scale into a big monopoly business.

### Characteristics of monopoly

There are several different characteristics of these monopoly businesses that I'd like to focus on. There is no single formula.

- In technology there is always a sense that in the history of technology, every moment happens only once.

- The next Mark Zuckerberg won’t build a social network and the next Larry Page won’t be building a search engine, and the next Bill Gates won’t be building an operating system. If you are copying these people, you are not learning from them.

There are always very unique businesses that are doing something that has not been done before and end up having the potential to be a monopoly.

The opening line in Anna Karenina, that all happy families are alike and all unhappy families are unhappy in their own special way, is not true in business, 

where I think all happy companies are different because they're doing something very unique. All unhappy companies are alike because they failed to escape the essential sameness in competition.

### Another one 

One characteristic of a monopoly technology company is some sort of proprietary technology.

My sort of crazy, somewhat arbitrary rule of thumb is you want to have a technology that's an order of magnitude better than the next best thing. 

- So Amazon had over ten times as many books, it may not have been that high tech, but you figure oh well it can sell ten times as many books and be more efficient along the way.

- In the case of PayPal, Bill Turner was using checks to send money on Ebay, it took seven to ten days to clear, and PayPal could do it more than ten times as fast.

- You want to have some sort of very powerful improvement, some order of magnitude improvement, on some key dimension.

- Of course, if you just come with something totally new, it's just like an infinite improvement.

I would say the iPhone was the first smart phone that worked, it may not be in fact, but it's so definitely an order of magnitude of an improvement. So I think the technology needs to be designed to give you a massive delta over the next the next best thing.

I think there often are network effects that can kick in and that really help the thing and these are linked to monopolies over time, 

The thing that is very tricky about network effects is they're often very hard to get started and so you know everyone understands how valuable they are.

There's always this incredibly tricky question: why is it valuable to the first person who's doing something. Economies of scale, if you have something with very high fixed costs and very low marginal costs, that's typically a monopoly-like business.

And then there is this thing of branding which is sort of this idea that gets lodged into people's brains. I never quite understand how branding works,
so I never invest in companies where it’s just about branding but it is, I think, a real phenomenon that creates real value.

I think one of the things, but one of the things that’s very striking is that software businesses are often, are for some reason, very good at some of these things. 

They are especially good at the economies of scale part because the marginal cost of software is zero. 

So if you get something that works in software it's often significantly better than the existing solution and then you have these tremendous economies of scale and you can scale fairly quickly.

So even if the market starts small, you can grow your business quickly enough to stay at the same size as the growing market and maintain the monopoly of power.

Now the critical thing about these monopolies is it's not enough to have a monopoly for just a moment. The critical thing is have one that lasts over time and so in Silicon Valley there is always this sort of idea that you want to be the first mover and I always think in some ways the better framing is you want to be the **last mover**.

You want to be one of the last companies in that category, those are the ones that are really valid.

Microsoft was the last operating system, at least for many decades. Google was the last search engine. Facebook will be valuable if it turns out to be the last of social networking site.


And one way to think of this last mover value is this idea that most of the value in these companies exists far in the future.

If you do a discounted cash flow analysis of the business, you'll look at all these profit streams, you have a growth rate, the growth rate’s much higher that the discount rate and 

So most of the value exists far in the future. I did this exercise at Pay Pal in March of 2001 we'd been in business for about twenty seven months and the growth rate was a hundred percent a year,

- we were discounting future cash flows by thirty percent, and it turned out that about three quarters of the value of the business as of 2001 came from cash flows in years 2011 and beyond.

- And whenever you do the math on any of these tech companies, you get to an answer that is something like that. So if you are trying to analyze any of the tech companies in Silicon Valley, AirBnB, Twitter, Facebook, any emerging Internet companies, all the ones in Y Combinator.

- The math tells you that three quarters, eighty-five percent of the value is coming from cash flows in years 2024 and beyond.

- It's very far in the future and so one of the things that we always over value in Silicon Valley is growth rates and we undervalue durability


Growth is something you can measure in the here and now, you can always track that very precisely. The question of whether a company will be around a decade from now, that’s actually what dominates the value equation and that’s a much more qualitative sort of a thing. And so if we went back to this idea of these characteristics of monopoly, the proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, you can think of these characteristics as ones that exist at a moment in time where you capture a market and take it over but you also want to think about, are these things going to last over time. So there’s a time dimension to all these characteristics. So networks in fact often have a great time element where as the network scales, network effects actually get more robust, and so if you have a network business it's often one that can become a bigger and stronger monopoly over time.
