## Co-founders

> Cofounder relationships are among the most important in the entire company. Everyone says you have to watch out for tension brewing among cofounders and you have to address is immediately. 
That's all true and certainly in YC's case, the number one cause of early death for startups is cofounder blowups. But for some reason, a lot of people treat choosing their cofounder with even less importance than hiring.
Don't do this! This is one of the most important decisions you make in the life of your startup and you need to treat it as such.

- And for some reason, students are really bad at this. They just pick someone. They're like, I want to start a business and you want to start a business, let's start a startup together. There are these cofounder dating things where you're like, Hey I'm looking for a cofounder, we don't really know each other, let's start a company. And this is like, crazy. You would never hire someone like this and yet people are willing to choose their business partners this way. It's really really bad. And choosing a random random cofounder, or choosing someone you don't have a long history with, choosing someone you're not friends with, so when things are really going wrong, you have this sort of past history to bind you together, usually ends up in disaster.

- **It's better to have no cofounder than to have a bad cofounder, but it's still bad to be a solo founder.**

- The top twenty most valuable YC companies, almost all of them have at least two founders. And we probably funded a rate of like one out of ten solo teams.


## Quality of Cofounders

- Need to be unflappable.
- Tough, they know what to do in every situation. 

- They act quickly, they're decisive, they're creative, they're ready for anything, and it turns out that there's a model for this in pop culture. And it sounds very dumb, but it's at least very memorable and we've told every class of YC this for a long time and I think it helps them.

- Shoud be smart & have technical knowledge.
- You really want to know your cofounders for awhile, ideally years. 

- You want a tough and a calm cofounder. There are obvious things like smart, but everyone knows you want a smart cofounder, they don't prioritize things like tough and calm enough, especially if you feel like you yourself aren't, you need a cofounder who is. 

- You want a technical cofounder. 

- There's this weird thing going on in startups right now where it's become popular to say, You know what, we don't need a technical cofounders, we're gonna hire people, we're just gonna be great managers. That doesn't work too well in our experience. 

- Software people should really be starting software companies. Media people should be starting media companies. In the YC experience, two or three cofounders seems to be about perfect. One, obviously not great, five, really bad. Four works sometimes, but two or three I think is the target.


## Try not to Hire

One of the weird things you'll notice as you start a company, is that everyone will ask you how many employees you have.

And this is the metric people use to judge how real your startup is and how cool you are. And if you say you have a high number of employees, they're really impressed.

And if you say you have a low number of employees, then you sound like this little joke.

But actually it sucks to have a lot of employees, and you should be proud of how few employees you have. Lots of employees ends up with things like
 - a high burn rate, meaning you're losing a lot of money every month, 
 - complexity, slow decision making, 
 - the list goes on and it's nothing good.

- Many of the best YC companies have had a phenomenally small number of employees for their first year, sometimes none besides the founders. They really try to stay small as long as they possibly can.

- At the beginning, you should only hire when you desperately need to. Later, you should learn to hire fast and scale up the company, but in the early days the goal should be not to hire. 

- Hiring too much just kills the company.

**Example**

> **Airbnb spent five months interviewing their first employee. And in their first year, they only hired two. 
Before they hired a single person, they wrote down a list of the culture values that they wanted any Airbnb employee to have.
One of those what that you had to bleed Airbnb, and if you didn't agree to that they just wouldn't hire you.
As an example of how intense Brian Chesky is, he's the Airbnb CEO, he used to ask people if they would take the job if they got a medical diagnosis that they have one year left to life. Later he decided that that was a little bit too crazy and I think he relaxed it to ten years, but last I heard, he still asks that question.**

- And when the company faced a big crisis early on, everyone lived in the office, and they shipped product every day until the crisis was over. 
- One of the remarkable observations about Airbnb is that if you talk to any of the first forty or so employees, they all feel like they were a part of the founding of the company.

## Get the Best Peopls

When you're in this hiring mode, it should be your number one priority to get the best people.

Just like when you're in product mode that should be your number one priority. 

And when you're in fundraising mode, fundraising is your number one priority.

### Time for hiring

how much time you should be spending on hiring?

> The answer is zero or twenty-five percent. You're either not hiring at all or it's probably your single biggest block of time. In practice, all these books on management say you should spend fifty percent of your time hiring, but the people that give that advice, it's rare for them to even spend ten percent themselves. 

Twenty-five percent is still a huge amount of time, but that's really how much you should be doing once you're in hiring mode.

### Great Advice

       Medicore engineers do not build best companies.
       
Not hire medicore candidates.

- We like to warn founders of this but no one really feels it until they make the mistake the first time, but it can poison the culture.
- Mediocre people at huge companies will cause some problems, but it won't kill the company.
- **A single mediocre hire within the first five will often in fact kill a startup.**

### Sources of candidates

 The best source for hiring by far is people that you already know and people that other employees in the company already know. Most great companies in tech have been built by personal referrals for the first hundred employees and often many more.
 
 Most founders feel awkward but calling anyone good that they've ever met and asking their employees to do the same.

- Another tip is to look outside the valley. It is brutally competitive to hire engineers here but you probably know people elsewhere in the world that would like to work with you.

**Another question that founders ask us a lot about his experience and how much that matters?**

> The short version here is that experience matters for some roles and not for others. 
When you're hiring someone that is going to run a large part of your organization experience probably matters a lot.
For most of the early hires that you make at a startup, experience probably doesn't matter that much and you should go for aptitude and belief in what you’re doing.

> Most of the best hires that I've made in my entire life have never done that thing before. So it's really worth thinking, is this a role where I care about experience or not. And you'll often find to don’t, especially in the early days.


## Skills looking for in Peoples:

1. Are they smart? 
2. Do they get things done?
3. Do I want to spend a lot of time to around them? 

If they have these qualities hire, you will not regret.

- You can learn a lot about all three of these things in an interview but the very best way is working together.

- Work with someone on a project for a day or two before hiring them. You'll both learn a lot they will too and most first-time founders are very bad interviewers but very good at evaluating someone after they've worked together.

- You should ask specifically about projects that someone worked on in the past. You'll learn a lot more than you will with brainteasers. For some reason, young technical cofounders love to ask brainteasers rather than just ask what someone has done.

> **And call references. That is another thing that first time founders like to skip. You want to call some people that these people have worked with in the past. And when you do, you don't just want to ask, How was so-and-so, you really want to dig in. Is this person in the top five percent of people you've ever worked with? What specifically did they do? Would you hire them again? Why aren't you trying to hire them again? You really have to press on these reference calls.**

### Also have qualities 

- Good Communication Skills
- Determined
- Feel comfortable reporting.
- You don't have to be friends with everybody, but you should at least enjoy working with them. 
- And if you don't have that, you should at least deeply respect them.
- But again, if you don't want to spend a lot of time around people you should trust your instincts about that.

### Employee equity

 Founders screw this up all the time. I think as a rough estimate, you should aim to give about ten percent of the company to the first ten employees.
They have to earn it over four years anyway, and if they're successful, they're going to contribute way more than that. They're going to increase the value of the company way more than that.

**Generous as you possibly can with employees.**
- You have to make sure your employees are happy and feel valued.

> you shouldn't tell your employees they're fucking up every day unless you want them all to leave because they will.

- Dan Pink talks about these three things that motivate people to do great work:
  - Autonomy 
  - Mastery
  - Purpose 
  
## Fire People

Firing people when it's not working.
Firing people is one of the worst parts of running a company.

Firing is very worst part. 

But the right answer is to fire fast when it's not working. It's better for the company, it's also better for the employee. But it's so painful and so awful, that everyone gets it wrong the first few times.

In addition to firing people who are doing bad at their job:

1. Creating office politics
2. Whoo are persistently negative

- The rest of the company is always aware of employees doing things like this, and it's just this huge drag - it's completely toxic to the company.

- Again, this is an example of something that might work OK in a big company, although I'm still skeptical, but will kill a startup. So that you need to watch out for people that are.

## FAQ 

**When should co-founders decide on the equity split?**

For some reason, I've never really been sure why this is, a lot of founders, a lot of co-founders like to leave this off for a very long time. You know, they'll even sign the incorporation documents in some crazy way so that they can wait to have this discussion.

This is not a discussion that gets easier with time, you wanna set this ideally very soon after you start working together. And it should be near-equal. If you're not willing to give someone - your co-founder - you know, like an equal share of the equity, I think that should make you think hard about whether or not you want them as a co-founder. But in any case, you should try to have the ink dry on this before the company gets too far along. Like, certainly in the first number of weeks.

**What happens when your relationship with your cofounder falls apart?**

Most important thing that founders screw up. Which is, every cofounder, you yourself of course, has to have vesting. 

Basically what you're doing with cofounder vesting is you're pre-negotiating what happens if one of you leaves.

And so the normal stance on this in Silicon Valley is that it takes four years, let's say you split the equity fifty-fifty, is that it takes four years to earn all of that. And the clock doesn't start until one year in. So if you leave after one year, you keep twenty-five percent of the equity, and if you leave after two years, fifty, and on and on like that.

If you don't do that and if you have a huge fallout and one founder leaves early on with half the company, you have this deadweight on your equity table, and it's very hard to get investors to fund you or to do anything else. So number one piece of advice to prevent that is to have vesting on the equity. We pretty much won't fund a company now where the founders don't have vested equity because it's just that bad. The other thing that comes up in the relationship between the cofounders, which happens to some degree in every company, is talk about it early, don't let it sit there and fester.


**What about cofounders that aren't working in the same location?** 

The answer is, don't do it. I am skeptical of remote teams in general but in the early days of a startup, when communication and speed outweigh everything else, for some reason video conferencing calls just don't work that well.

- The data on this is look at say the 30 successful software companies of all time and try to point to a single example where the cofounders were in different locations. It's really really tough.

## 4. Execution

> Execution for most founders is not the most fun part of running the company, but it is the most critical.
Many cofounders think they're just signing up to this beautiful idea and then they're going to go be on magazine covers and go to parties.
But really what it’s about more than anything else, what being a cofounder really means, is signing up for this years long grind on execution and you can’t outsource this.

### Super Important

- The way to have a company that executes well is you have to execute well yourself.
- Every thing at a startup gets modeled after the founders. Whatever the founders do becomes the culture. So if you want a culture where people work hard, pay attention to detail, manage the customers, are frugal, you have to do it yourself.

- There is no other way. You cannot hire a COO ( chief operating officer ) to do that while you go off to conferences. The company just needs to see you as this maniacal execution machine. 

- There’s at least a hundred times more people with great ideas than people who are willing to put in the effort to execute them well. Ideas by themselves are not worth anything, only executing well is what adds and creates value.

### 5 Main jobs of CEO

- Set the vision
- Raise money
- Evangilize (recuriting, running,  press )
- Hire and manage
- Make sure the entire company execute

## Focus

  So can you get done it????
  
There will be a lot of things to done but you can done only 2 or 3 

**where are you spending time and money?**

**what are the two imporant things to do?**

You must need to done otherwise it can be very difficult.

> if you don't get good at setting what those two or three things are, you'll never be good at getting stuff done. This is really hard for founders. Founders get excited about starting new things.

So then there's this question of how do you figure out what to focus on each day. 
**Each day it's really important to have goals.** Most good founders have a set of small overarching goals for the company that everybody in the company knows.
You know it could be something like 
 - ship a product by this date, 
 - get this certain growth rate, 
 - get this engagement rate, 
 - hire for these key roles, 
 - those are some of them but everyone in the company can tell you each week what are our key goals. 
 And then everybody executes based off of that.

## Care About

1. Saya a lot
2. Set the goals 
3. Commnuicate
4. Maintian growth & momentum
5. Work together in person 

**Success of Startup is with extreme Focus and dedication.** 

> You can have a startup and one other thing, you can have a family, but you probably can't have many other things. Startups are not the best choice for work life balance and that's sort of just the sad reality. There's a lot of great things about a startup, but this is not one of them. Startups are all-consuming in a way that is generally difficult to explain. You basically need to be willing to outwork your competitors.

### Intensity

- Releteness operating rythm ( move fast and break things like fb or google ) 
- Obsession with execution quality
- Bias towards action ( do not just talk, just do quickly ) 
- Quickly 
- Do whatever it takes 
- Do not give up
- Show up
- Be courageous
- Move speedly
- Future of Startup depends 


> Momentum and growth are lifeblood of Startups.

**Always keep momentum, Always keep growing**

If you cannot keep momentum and growth
fix the small one and keep momentum 
And 
   **Sales fix everything in Startup**
   
### For momentum and growth

Operating rythm 
- Shipping product
- Launching new features 
- Reviewing / reporting metrics and milestones

Do not use money which you don't have!

> This great quote from Henry Ford that I love: **“The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time.”**
