### Why you should start Start-up?

Every one whos start start-up always says that you couldn't imagine how hard and painful it is going to be. 

You should start start-up that you can feel compelled by a particular problem and that you can think starting a company you can solve that probelm.


**Passion** should come first and **Start-up** second. 

## 1. Great Idea

It's become popular in recent years that Idea doesn't matter, you do not need to spend a lot of time on **Idea**.  

You just supposed to start, even do not think it is valube work. So this is **totally wrong**. 

A bad idea is still bad.

Most great companies start with **great idea**. If you look at successful start-ups they alawys have a good idea.

### Def of Idea
The defination of idea is very broad it includes the **size and the growth** of the market.
- The growth strategy for the company.
- The defensibility strategy and so on...

When you are evaluting an idea you need to think through all these things, not just the product.
If it works out you are going to work for **10 Years** So its worth some real upfront time to think there's a long term value in the defensibilty of busines.

Even though plans themselves are worthless the **exercise of planning** is really valuable and totally missing in most start-ups.
Long term thinking is so important in startups, that is huge advantage if you do it.

**Remember:**

>  The idea will expand and become more ambitious you go. You certainly don't need to figured out in a path from here to the world donmination.

> You are thinking through ideas another thing that we see young founders get wrong all the time is that someday you need to build business that's difficult to replicate ( important to remember it ).
If you have several ideas that all seem pretty good work on the one which you often think about it.

**Tip:**

   Most founders that they wish they have waited to start a start-up until they came up with an idea they really loved.
   Another way to looking this is that the best companies are almost always mission oriented.

The company should feel like an ***important mission***. It take years and years, even decades to create a great start-up.
If you do not love and believe in what are you building you will likely to give up at some point.

A lot of founders and usually students belive that their start-ups only going to take two or three years and after that they will work on what they really passionate, that almost never works out, good startups usually takes **10 Years**.

Another advantage of mission oriented company is that outsider peoples will help and support.

#### Hard Part

     - The hardest part about coming up with great ideas is that the best ideas often look very terrible at the beginning.
     
**Seems like a bad idea** Start-Up **This a good idea**.

You need to turn out your idea into monopoly but you cannot get monopoly in the big market, righ wat too much competition, For that you need to find small market in which you can get monopoly and then expand quickly.

This is why some great startup ideas look really bad in the beginning its.


### Keep in mind:

There is a really hard part a great idea most people are going to think about it's a bad, you should be happy about that. Means they will not compete with you.

You are also really wanna take the time to think about how the market is going to evolve you, u need to a market that is going to be big in next 10 years.


In fact, I think this is one of the biggest systemic mistakes that investors make.
They think about the growth of the start-up itself, they don't think about the growth of the market.

**You should think about this above.**


### While a student

 Being a student one of the two biggest advantages are:
   - You probably have better intuition about which markets are likely to start growing rapidly than older people do.
   - Another thing that students usually don't understand, or it takes awhile, 
   - You can not create a market that does not want to exist.
   - You can basically change everything in a start-up but the market, so you should actually do some thinking to be sure that the market you're    going after is going to grow and be there.
   - you've got a very good perspective on new technology.
   - Think about new ideas.
   - And learning to have good ideas takes a while,
   - So start working on that right now. That's one thing we hear from people all the time, that they wish they had done more of as a student.
   
   

### Right Market

There are a lot of different ways to talk about the right kind of market. 

- For example, surfing some one else's wave, 
   - stepping into an up elevator, or being part of a movement, but all of this is just a way of saying that you want a market that's going to grow really quickly. 
 - It may be small today, but you know and other people don't that it's going to grow really fast.
 
 **Marc Andreessen says, software is eating the world** 

So think about where this is happening in the world. You need this sort of tailwind to make a startup successful.


> There are so many great ideas out there. You just have to pick one, and find one that you really care about.


### Why Now?

Sequoia's famous question: Why now? 
 - Why is this the perfect time for this particular idea and to start this particular company?
 - Why couldn't it be done two years ago, and why will two years in the future be too late?
 - For the most successful startups we've been involved with, they've all had a great idea and a great answer to this question.
 - And if you don't you should be at least somewhat suspicious about it.
 
 
 ### Quote from 50 Cent
 
 It's about the importance of thinking about what customers want, and thinking about the demands of the market.
 
 Most people don't do this—most students especially don't do this. If you can just do this one thing, 
 if you can just learn to think about the market first, you'll have a big leg up on most people starting startups.
 
 And this is probably the thing we see wrong with Y Combinator apps most frequently, is that people have not thought about the market first, and what people want first.
 
 
 ## 2. Great Product
 
 Very broad definition of product is 
  - It includes customer support, the copy you write explaining the product, anything involved in your customer's interaction in what you built for    them.
  - **To build a really great company, you first have to turn a great idea into a great product.**
  - This is really hard, but its crucially important, and fortunately its pretty fun.
  - Although great products are always new to the world, and its hard to give you advice about what to build, there are enough commonalities that   we can give you a lot of advice about how to build it.
  
  
  **Most important tasks**
  
    Most important task for a founder is to make sure that the company builds a great product.
 
 Until you build a great product, nothing else matters. When really successful startup founders tell the story of their early days its almost always sitting in front of the computer working on their product, or talking to their customers.
 
 That's pretty much all the time. They do very little else, and you should be very skeptical if your time allocation is much different.
 Most other problems that founders are trying to solve:
  - raising money,
  - getting more press, 
  - hiring, 
  - business development, etc.
  
  These are significantly easier when you have a **great product**.
  Its really important to take care of PRODUCT first.
  
### Steps to build Product

- Step one is to build something that users love.
- Talk to users
At YC, we tell founders to work on their product,
  - talk to users, 
  - exercise, 
  - eat and sleep, 
  - very little else.
  - All the other stuff I just mentioned—PR, conferences, recruiting advisers, doing partnerships—you should ignore all of that.
    - **Just build a product and get it as good as possible by talking to your users.**
 
### NoteAble

  > A lot of good-on-paper startups fail because they merely make something that people like. Making something that people want, but only a medium amount, is a great way to fail, and not understand why you're failing.
    
- Its better to build something that a small number of users love, then a large number of users like.
- Of course, it would be best to build something that a small number of users love, but opportunities to do that for v1 are rare, and they're usually not available to startups.


### Advice

 This is a very important piece of advice. 
 Build something that a small number of users love. It is much easier to expand from something that small number of people love, to something that a lot of people love, then from something that a lot of people like to a lot of people love.
 
 So the advice is: find a small group of users, and make them love what you're doing.
 
 ### Growth
 
 One way that you know when this is working, is that you'll get growth by word of mouth. 
 If you get something people love, people will tell their friends about it. This works for consumer product and enterprise  products as well.
 
 When people really love something, they'll tell their friends about it, and you'll see organic growth.

If you find yourself talking about how it's okay that you're not growing—because there's a big partnership that's going to come save you or something like that—its almost always a sign of real trouble.

Sales and marketing are really important.

But if you do not have some early organic growth then its mean your product is not probably good yet,

> Over the long run, great product win. Don't worry about your competitors raising a lot of money, or what they might do in the future. They probably aren't very good anyway. Very few startups die from competition. Most die because they themselves fail to make something users love, they spend their time on other things. So worry about this above all else.
 
 ### Great Products Win
 
 Another piece of advice to make something that users love:
 
 Start with something simple.
  - Its much much easier to make a great product if you have something simple. 
  - Even if your eventual plans are super complex, and hopefully they are, you can almost always start with a smaller subset of the problem then you think is the smallest, and its hard to build a great product, so you want to start with as little surface area as possible.
  
 - Think about the really successful companies, and what they started with, think about products you really love. 
 
  - They're generally incredibly simple to use, and especially to get started using. The first version of Facebook was almost comically simple.
  
  - The first version of Google was just a webpage with a textbox and two buttons; but it returned the best results, and that's why users loved it. The iPhone is far simpler to use then any smartphone that ever came before it, and it was the first one users really loved.
  
 ### Fanatical
 
 The word fanatical comes up again and again when you listen to successful founders talk about how they think about their product.
 
 Founders talk about being fanatical in how they care about the quality of the small details. Fanatical in getting the copy that they use to explain the product just right.
 
 and fanatical in the way that they think about customer support. In fact, one thing that correlates with success among the YC companies is the founders that hook up Pagerduty to their ticketing system, so that even if the user emails in the middle of the night when the founder's asleep, they still get a response within an hour.
 
Companies actually do this in the early days. Their founders feel physical pain when the product sucks and they want to wake up and fix it. They don't ship crap, and if they do, they fix it very very quickly.

And it definitely takes some level of fanaticism to build great products.


### Feedback

You need some users to help with the feedback cycle, but the way you should get those users is manually
- you should go recruit them by hand. Don't do things like buy Google ads in the early days, to get initial users.
- You don't need very many, you just need ones that will give you feedback everyday, and eventually love your product. So instead of trying to get them on Google Adwords, just the few people, in the world, that would be good users. Recruit them by hand.









Co-founders

Shoud be smart & have technical knowledge
Not should be random one ( janty na ho )
You shoud know him

Hiring Process:

At Starting not Hire too much employes
