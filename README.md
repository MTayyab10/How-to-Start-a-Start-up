# How to start a StartUp


### Note :

       Startup are different than normal companies.

Course at Stanford Uni. Here is the YT [link](https://youtu.be/CVfnkM44Urs)

## Why you should start Start-up?

Every one whos start start-up always says that you couldn't imagine how hard and painful it is going to be. 

You should start start-up that you can feel compelled by a particular problem and that you can think starting a company you can solve that probelm.

**Passion** should come first and **Start-up** second. 

### Common Reasons to become a Tech Entrepreneur

Here the most common reasons for Start-up
- It's glamorous
- You'll get to be the boss
- You'll have flexibility, especially over your schedule
- You'll have the chance to have bigger impact 
- You'll make more $$$ money
then you might by joining a later stage company.

### Ugly side of being a Founder 

- Reality is just not quite so glamorous.
- There's an ugly side to being an entrepreneur, and more importantly, 
- what you're actually spending your time on is just a lot of hard work. 
- your basically just sitting at your desk, 
  - Heads down, 
  - Focused, 
  - Answering customer support emails,
  - Doing sales,
  - Figuring out hard engineering problems.
 
- So its really important that you go in with eyes wide open.
- And then its also quite stressful. 

- This has been a popular topic in the press lately: The Economist actually ran a story just last week called "Entreupeneurs anonymous", and shows a founder like hiding under his desk, talking about founder depression.

- So this is a very real thing. 
- Let's be real, if you start a company its going to be **extremely hard**.

### Why is it so stressful?

Here are couple of reasons:

- You've got a lot of responsibility.

- People in any career have a fear of failure, its kind of just like a dominant part of the part of the psychology.

- But when you're an entrepreneur, you have fear of failure on behalf of yourself and all of the people who decided to follow you. 

- So that's really stressful. In some cases people are depending on you for their livelihood, even when that's not true, they've decided to devote the best years of their life to following you. 

- So you're responsible for the opportunity cost of their time. 
- You're always on call, if something comes up—maybe not always at 3 in the morning, but for some startups that's true—but if something important comes up, you're going to deal with it. 
- That's doesn't matter if you're on vacation, doesn't matter if its the weekend, you've got to always be on the ball and be in a place mentally where you're prepared to deal with those things.

- A sort of special example of this kind of stress is **fundraising**.

- If you're at a startup and it's very stressful and things are not going well, you're unhappy, you can just leave. For a founder, you can leave, but it's very uncool and pretty much a black eye for the rest of your career.

- **So if you're lucky and you have a bad startup idea, you fail quickly, but most of the time it's not like that.**

### Anxiety & Stress


> If you do start a company, be aware that you're going to deal with this. You're going to have to actually manage this, it's one of your core responsibilities. Ben Horowitz likes to say the number one role of a CEO is managing your own psychology, it's absolutely true, make sure you do it.

## Four Areas for Start-up

1. [Idea](https://github.com/MTayyab10/How-to-start-Start-up/blob/main/README.md#1-great-idea) 
2. [Product](https://github.com/MTayyab10/How-to-start-Start-up/blob/main/README.md#2-great-product)
3. [Team](https://github.com/MTayyab10/How-to-start-Start-up/blob/main/README.md#3-great-team)
4. Execution


## 1. Great Idea

It's become popular in recent years that Idea doesn't matter, you do not need to spend a lot of time on **Idea**.  

You just supposed to start, even do not think it is valube work. So this is **totally wrong**. 

A bad idea is still bad.

Most great companies start with **great idea**. If you look at successful start-ups they alawys have a good idea.

### Def of Idea
The defination of idea is very broad it includes the **size and the growth** of the market.
- The growth strategy for the company.
- The defensibility strategy and so on...

When you are evaluting an idea you need to think through all these things, not just the product.
If it works out you are going to work for **10 Years** So its worth some real upfront time to think there's a long term value in the defensibilty of busines.

Even though plans themselves are worthless the **exercise of planning** is really valuable and totally missing in most start-ups.
Long term thinking is so important in startups, that is huge advantage if you do it.

**Remember:**

>  The idea will expand and become more ambitious you go. You certainly don't need to figured out in a path from here to the world donmination.

> You are thinking through ideas another thing that we see young founders get wrong all the time is that someday you need to build business that's difficult to replicate ( important to remember it ).
If you have several ideas that all seem pretty good work on the one which you often think about it.

**Tip:**

   Most founders that they wish they have waited to start a start-up until they came up with an idea they really loved.
   Another way to looking this is that the best companies are almost always mission oriented.

The company should feel like an ***important mission***. It take years and years, even decades to create a great start-up.
If you do not love and believe in what are you building you will likely to give up at some point.

A lot of founders and usually students belive that their start-ups only going to take two or three years and after that they will work on what they really passionate, that almost never works out, good startups usually takes **10 Years**.

Another advantage of mission oriented company is that outsider peoples will help and support.

#### Hard Part

     The hardest part about great ideas is that the best ideas look terrible at the beginning.
     
**Seems like a bad idea** Start-Up **This a good idea**.

You need to turn out your idea into monopoly but you cannot get monopoly in the big market, righ wat too much competition, For that you need to find small market in which you can get monopoly and then expand quickly.

This is why some great startup ideas look really bad in the beginning its.


### Keep in mind:

There is a really hard part a great idea most people are going to think about it's a bad, you should be happy about that. Means they will not compete with you.

You are also really wanna take the time to think about how the market is going to evolve you, u need to a market that is going to be big in next 10 years.


In fact, I think this is one of the biggest systemic mistakes that investors make.
They think about the growth of the start-up itself, they don't think about the growth of the market.

**You should think about this above.**


### While a Student

 Being a student one of the two biggest advantages are:
   - You probably have better intuition about which markets are likely to start growing rapidly than older people do.
   - Another thing that students usually don't understand, or it takes awhile, 
   - You can not create a market that does not want to exist.
   - You can basically change everything in a start-up but the market, so you should actually do some thinking to be sure that the market you're going after is going to grow and be there.
   - you've got a very good perspective on new technology.
   - Think about new ideas.
   - And learning to have good ideas takes a while,
   - So start working on that right now. That's one thing we hear from people all the time, that they wish they had done more of as a student.   
   

### Right Market

There are a lot of different ways to talk about the right kind of market. 

- For example, surfing some one else's wave, 
   - stepping into an up elevator, or being part of a movement, but all of this is just a way of saying that you want a market that's going to grow really quickly. 
 - It may be small today, but you know and other people don't that it's going to grow really fast.
 
 **Marc Andreessen says, software is eating the world** 

So think about where this is happening in the world. You need this sort of tailwind to make a startup successful.


> There are so many great ideas out there. You just have to pick one, and find one that you really care about.


### Why Now?

Sequoia's famous question: Why now? 
 - Why is this the perfect time for this particular idea and to start this particular company?
 - Why couldn't it be done two years ago, and why will two years in the future be too late?
 - For the most successful startups we've been involved with, they've all had a great idea and a great answer to this question.
 - And if you don't you should be at least somewhat suspicious about it.
 
 
 ### Quote from 50 Cent
 
 It's about the importance of thinking about what customers want, and thinking about the demands of the market.
 
 Most people don't do this—most students especially don't do this. If you can just do this one thing, 
 if you can just learn to think about the market first, you'll have a big leg up on most people starting startups.
 
 And this is probably the thing we see wrong with Y Combinator apps most frequently, is that people have not thought about the market first, and what people want first.
 
 
 ## 2. Great Product
 
 Very broad definition of product is 
  - It includes customer support, the copy you write explaining the product, anything involved in your customer's interaction in what you built for    them.
  - **To build a really great company, you first have to turn a great idea into a great product.**
  - This is really hard, but its crucially important, and fortunately its pretty fun.
  - Although great products are always new to the world, and its hard to give you advice about what to build, there are enough commonalities that   we can give you a lot of advice about how to build it.
  
  
  **Most important tasks**
  
    Most important task for a founder is to make sure that the company builds a great product.
 
 Until you build a great product, nothing else matters. When really successful startup founders tell the story of their early days its almost always sitting in front of the computer working on their product, or talking to their customers.
 
 That's pretty much all the time. They do very little else, and you should be very skeptical if your time allocation is much different.
 Most other problems that founders are trying to solve:
  - raising money,
  - getting more press, 
  - hiring, 
  - business development, etc.
  
  These are significantly easier when you have a **great product**.
  Its really important to take care of PRODUCT first.
  
### Steps to build Product

- Step one is to build something that users love.
- Talk to users
At YC, we tell founders to work on their product,
  - talk to users, 
  - exercise, 
  - eat and sleep, 
  - very little else.
  - All the other stuff I just mentioned—PR, conferences, recruiting advisers, doing partnerships—you should ignore all of that.
    - **Just build a product and get it as good as possible by talking to your users.**
 
### NoteAble

  > A lot of good-on-paper startups fail because they merely make something that people like. Making something that people want, but only a medium amount, is a great way to fail, and not understand why you're failing.
    
- Its better to build something that a small number of users love, then a large number of users like.
- Of course, it would be best to build something that a small number of users love, but opportunities to do that for v1 are rare, and they're usually not available to startups.


### Advice

 This is a very important piece of advice. 
 Build something that a small number of users love. It is much easier to expand from something that small number of people love, to something that a lot of people love, then from something that a lot of people like to a lot of people love.
 
 So the advice is: find a small group of users, and make them love what you're doing.
 
 ### Growth
 
 One way that you know when this is working, is that you'll get growth by word of mouth. 
 If you get something people love, people will tell their friends about it. This works for consumer product and enterprise  products as well.
 
 When people really love something, they'll tell their friends about it, and you'll see organic growth.

If you find yourself talking about how it's okay that you're not growing—because there's a big partnership that's going to come save you or something like that—its almost always a sign of real trouble.

Sales and marketing are really important.

But if you do not have some early organic growth then its mean your product is not probably good yet,

> Over the long run, great product win. Don't worry about your competitors raising a lot of money, or what they might do in the future. They probably aren't very good anyway. Very few startups die from competition. Most die because they themselves fail to make something users love, they spend their time on other things. So worry about this above all else.
 
 ### Great Products Win
 
 Another piece of advice to make something that users love:
 
 Start with something simple.
  - Its much much easier to make a great product if you have something simple. 
  - Even if your eventual plans are super complex, and hopefully they are, you can almost always start with a smaller subset of the problem then you think is the smallest, and its hard to build a great product, so you want to start with as little surface area as possible.
  
 - Think about the really successful companies, and what they started with, think about products you really love. 
 
  - They're generally incredibly simple to use, and especially to get started using. The first version of Facebook was almost comically simple.
  
  - The first version of Google was just a webpage with a textbox and two buttons; but it returned the best results, and that's why users loved it. The iPhone is far simpler to use then any smartphone that ever came before it, and it was the first one users really loved.
  
 ### Fanatical
 
 The word fanatical comes up again and again when you listen to successful founders talk about how they think about their product.
 
 Founders talk about being fanatical in how they care about the quality of the small details. Fanatical in getting the copy that they use to explain the product just right.
 
 and fanatical in the way that they think about customer support. In fact, one thing that correlates with success among the YC companies is the founders that hook up Pagerduty to their ticketing system, so that even if the user emails in the middle of the night when the founder's asleep, they still get a response within an hour.
 
Companies actually do this in the early days. Their founders feel physical pain when the product sucks and they want to wake up and fix it. They don't ship crap, and if they do, they fix it very very quickly.

And it definitely takes some level of fanaticism to build great products.


### Feedback

You need some users to help with the feedback cycle, but the way you should get those users is manually
- you should go recruit them by hand. Don't do things like buy Google ads in the early days, to get initial users.
- You don't need very many, you just need ones that will give you feedback everyday, and eventually love your product. So instead of trying to get them on Google Adwords, just the few people, in the world, that would be good users. Recruit them by hand.

### Pinterest Joke 

Ben Silbermann, when everyone thought Pinterest was a joke, recruited the initial Pinterest users by chatting up strangers in coffee shops. 

- He really did, he just walked around Palo Alto and said "Will you please use my product?" He also used to run around the Apple store in Palo Alto, and he would like set all the browsers to the Pinterest homepage real quick, before they caught him and kicked him out, and so that when people walked in they were like "Oh, what's this?".

- This is an important example of doing things that don't scale. If you haven't read Paul Graham's essay on that topic, you definitely should.


### Engine of a Company

You want to build an engine in the company that 

 - **transforms feedback from users into product decisions.**
 
 - Then get it back in from of the users and repeat. 
 
 - Ask them what the like and don't like, and watch them use it. Ask them what they'd pay for.
  
 - Ask them if they'd be really bummed if your company went away. 
  
 - Ask them what would make them recommend the product to their friends, and ask them if they'd recommended it to any yet.
 
 **Great Founders**
 
1. Great founders don't put anyone between themselves and their users. 

2. The founders of these companies do things like sales and customer support themselves in the early days. 

3. Its critical to get this loop embedded in the culture.

4. In fact, a specific problem we always see with Stanford startups, for some reason, is that the students try to hire sales and customer support people right away, and you've got to do this yourself, its the only way.

### Metrics: Focus on Growth

 It really is true that the company will build whatever the CEO decides to measure.
 
 > If you're building an Internet service, ignore things like total registrations, don't talk about them, don't let anyone in the company talk about them.
 
 And look at 
  - Growth and active users
  - Ativity levels 
  - Cohort retention,
  - Revenue, 
  - Net promoter scores
  
  these things that matter. And then be brutally honest if they're not going in the right direction. Startups live on growth, its the indicator of a great product.
  

## Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ )

**How do I identify if a market has a fast growth rate now and also for the next ten years?**

The good news about this is this is one of the big advantages students have. You should just trust your instincts on this.

Older people have to basically guess about the technologies young people are using. But you can just watch what you're doing and what your friends are doing and you will almost certainly have better instincts than anybody older than you.

And so the answer to this is just trust your instincts, think about what you're doing more, think about what you're using, what you're seeing people your age using, that will almost certainly be the future.

**How do you deal with burnout while still being productive and remaining productive?**

The answer to this is just that it sucks and you keep going. 

Unlike a student where you can throw up your hands and say you know I'm really burnt out and I'm just going to get bad grades this quarter.

One of the hard parts about **running a startup is that it's real life** and you just have to get through it. The canonical advice is to go on a vacation and that never works for founders. It's sort of all consuming in this way that is very difficult to understand.

## 3. Great Team

    Learn how to hire and how to execute. Hopefully you don't execute the people you hire.
    
### Co-founders

> Cofounder relationships are among the most important in the entire company. Everyone says you have to watch out for tension brewing among cofounders and you have to address is immediately. That's all true and certainly in YC's case, the number one cause of early death for startups is cofounder blowups. But for some reason, a lot of people treat choosing their cofounder with even less importance than hiring. Don't do this! This is one of the most important decisions you make in the life of your startup and you need to treat it as such.

- And for some reason, students are really bad at this. They just pick someone. They're like, I want to start a business and you want to start a business, let's start a startup together. There are these cofounder dating things where you're like, Hey I'm looking for a cofounder, we don't really know each other, let's start a company. And this is like, crazy. You would never hire someone like this and yet people are willing to choose their business partners this way. It's really really bad. And choosing a random random cofounder, or choosing someone you don't have a long history with, choosing someone you're not friends with, so when things are really going wrong, you have this sort of past history to bind you together, usually ends up in disaster.

- **It's better to have no cofounder than to have a bad cofounder, but it's still bad to be a solo founder.**

- The top twenty most valuable YC companies, almost all of them have at least two founders. And we probably funded a rate of like one out of ten solo teams.


### Quality of Cofounders

- Need to be unflappable.
- Tough, they know what to do in every situation. 

- They act quickly, they're decisive, they're creative, they're ready for anything, and it turns out that there's a model for this in pop culture. And it sounds very dumb, but it's at least very memorable and we've told every class of YC this for a long time and I think it helps them.

- Shoud be smart & have technical knowledge.
- You really want to know your cofounders for awhile, ideally years. 

- You want a tough and a calm cofounder. There are obvious things like smart, but everyone knows you want a smart cofounder, they don't prioritize things like tough and calm enough, especially if you feel like you yourself aren't, you need a cofounder who is. 

- You want a technical cofounder. 

- There's this weird thing going on in startups right now where it's become popular to say, You know what, we don't need a technical cofounders, we're gonna hire people, we're just gonna be great managers. That doesn't work too well in our experience. 

- Software people should really be starting software companies. Media people should be starting media companies. In the YC experience, two or three cofounders seems to be about perfect. One, obviously not great, five, really bad. Four works sometimes, but two or three I think is the target.


### Try not to Hire

One of the weird things you'll notice as you start a company, is that everyone will ask you how many employees you have.

And this is the metric people use to judge how real your startup is and how cool you are. And if you say you have a high number of employees, they're really impressed.

And if you say you have a low number of employees, then you sound like this little joke.

But actually it sucks to have a lot of employees, and you should be proud of how few employees you have. Lots of employees ends up with things like
 - a high burn rate, meaning you're losing a lot of money every month, 
 - complexity, slow decision making, 
 - the list goes on and it's nothing good.

- Many of the best YC companies have had a phenomenally small number of employees for their first year, sometimes none besides the founders. They really try to stay small as long as they possibly can.

- At the beginning, you should only hire when you desperately need to. Later, you should learn to hire fast and scale up the company, but in the early days the goal should be not to hire. 

- Hiring too much just kills the company.

**Example**

> **Airbnb spent five months interviewing their first employee. And in their first year, they only hired two. 
Before they hired a single person, they wrote down a list of the culture values that they wanted any Airbnb employee to have.
One of those what that you had to bleed Airbnb, and if you didn't agree to that they just wouldn't hire you.
As an example of how intense Brian Chesky is, he's the Airbnb CEO, he used to ask people if they would take the job if they got a medical diagnosis that they have one year left to life. Later he decided that that was a little bit too crazy and I think he relaxed it to ten years, but last I heard, he still asks that question.**

- And when the company faced a big crisis early on, everyone lived in the office, and they shipped product every day until the crisis was over. 
- One of the remarkable observations about Airbnb is that if you talk to any of the first forty or so employees, they all feel like they were a part of the founding of the company.

### Get the Best Peopls

When you're in this hiring mode, it should be your number one priority to get the best people.

Just like when you're in product mode that should be your number one priority. 

And when you're in fundraising mode, fundraising is your number one priority.

#### Time for hiring

how much time you should be spending on hiring?
> The answer is zero or twenty-five percent. You're either not hiring at all or it's probably your single biggest block of time. In practice, all these books on management say you should spend fifty percent of your time hiring, but the people that give that advice, it's rare for them to even spend ten percent themselves. 

Twenty-five percent is still a huge amount of time, but that's really how much you should be doing once you're in hiring mode.

### Great Advice

       Medicore engineers do not build best companies.
       
Not hire medicore candidates.

- We like to warn founders of this but no one really feels it until they make the mistake the first time, but it can poison the culture.
- Mediocre people at huge companies will cause some problems, but it won't kill the company.
- **A single mediocre hire within the first five will often in fact kill a startup.**

### Sources of candidates

 The best source for hiring by far is people that you already know and people that other employees in the company already know. Most great companies in tech have been built by personal referrals for the first hundred employees and often many more.
 
 Most founders feel awkward but calling anyone good that they've ever met and asking their employees to do the same.

- Another tip is to look outside the valley. It is brutally competitive to hire engineers here but you probably know people elsewhere in the world that would like to work with you.

**Another question that founders ask us a lot about his experience and how much that matters?**

> The short version here is that experience matters for some roles and not for others. 
When you're hiring someone that is going to run a large part of your organization experience probably matters a lot.
For most of the early hires that you make at a startup, experience probably doesn't matter that much and you should go for aptitude and belief in what you’re doing.

> Most of the best hires that I've made in my entire life have never done that thing before. So it's really worth thinking, is this a role where I care about experience or not. And you'll often find to don’t, especially in the early days.


### Skills looking for in Peoples:

1. Are they smart? 
2. Do they get things done?
3. Do I want to spend a lot of time to around them? 

If they have these qualities hire, you will not regret.

- You can learn a lot about all three of these things in an interview but the very best way is working together.

- Work with someone on a project for a day or two before hiring them. You'll both learn a lot they will too and most first-time founders are very bad interviewers but very good at evaluating someone after they've worked together.

- You should ask specifically about projects that someone worked on in the past. You'll learn a lot more than you will with brainteasers. For some reason, young technical cofounders love to ask brainteasers rather than just ask what someone has done.

> **And call references. That is another thing that first time founders like to skip. You want to call some people that these people have worked with in the past. And when you do, you don't just want to ask, How was so-and-so, you really want to dig in. Is this person in the top five percent of people you've ever worked with? What specifically did they do? Would you hire them again? Why aren't you trying to hire them again? You really have to press on these reference calls.**

### Also have qualities 

- Good Communication Skills
- Determined
- Feel comfortable reporting.
- You don't have to be friends with everybody, but you should at least enjoy working with them. 
- And if you don't have that, you should at least deeply respect them.
- But again, if you don't want to spend a lot of time around people you should trust your instincts about that.

### Employee equity

 Founders screw this up all the time. I think as a rough estimate, you should aim to give about ten percent of the company to the first ten employees.
They have to earn it over four years anyway, and if they're successful, they're going to contribute way more than that. They're going to increase the value of the company way more than that.

**Generous as you possibly can with employees.**
- You have to make sure your employees are happy and feel valued.

> you shouldn't tell your employees they're fucking up every day unless you want them all to leave because they will.

- Dan Pink talks about these three things that motivate people to do great work:
  - Autonomy 
  - Mastery
  - Purpose 
  
### Fire People

Firing people when it's not working.
Firing people is one of the worst parts of running a company.

Actually in my own experience, I'd say it is the very worst part. 
Every first time founder waits too long, everyone hopes that an employee will turn around.
But the right answer is to fire fast when it's not working. It's better for the company, it's also better for the employee. But it's so painful and so awful, that everyone gets it wrong the first few times.

In addition to firing people who are doing bad at their job:

1. creating office politics
2. who are persistently negative

- The rest of the company is always aware of employees doing things like this, and it's just this huge drag - it's completely toxic to the company.

- Again, this is an example of something that might work OK in a big company, although I'm still skeptical, but will kill a startup. So that you need to watch out for people that are.

## FAQ 

**When should co-founders decide on the equity split?**

For some reason, I've never really been sure why this is, a lot of founders, a lot of co-founders like to leave this off for a very long time. You know, they'll even sign the incorporation documents in some crazy way so that they can wait to have this discussion.

This is not a discussion that gets easier with time, you wanna set this ideally very soon after you start working together. And it should be near-equal. If you're not willing to give someone - your co-founder - you know, like an equal share of the equity, I think that should make you think hard about whether or not you want them as a co-founder. But in any case, you should try to have the ink dry on this before the company gets too far along. Like, certainly in the first number of weeks.

**What happens when your relationship with your cofounder falls apart?**

Most important thing that founders screw up. Which is, every cofounder, you yourself of course, has to have vesting. 

Basically what you're doing with cofounder vesting is you're pre-negotiating what happens if one of you leaves.

And so the normal stance on this in Silicon Valley is that it takes four years, let's say you split the equity fifty-fifty, is that it takes four years to earn all of that. And the clock doesn't start until one year in. So if you leave after one year, you keep twenty-five percent of the equity, and if you leave after two years, fifty, and on and on like that.

If you don't do that and if you have a huge fallout and one founder leaves early on with half the company, you have this deadweight on your equity table, and it's very hard to get investors to fund you or to do anything else. So number one piece of advice to prevent that is to have vesting on the equity. We pretty much won't fund a company now where the founders don't have vested equity because it's just that bad. The other thing that comes up in the relationship between the cofounders, which happens to some degree in every company, is talk about it early, don't let it sit there and fester.


**What about cofounders that aren't working in the same location?** 

The answer is, don't do it. I am skeptical of remote teams in general but in the early days of a startup, when communication and speed outweigh everything else, for some reason video conferencing calls just don't work that well.

- The data on this is look at say the 30 successful software companies of all time and try to point to a single example where the cofounders were in different locations. It's really really tough.

## 4. Execution

> Execution for most founders is not the most fun part of running the company, but it is the most critical.
Many cofounders think they're just signing up to this beautiful idea and then they're going to go be on magazine covers and go to parties.
But really what it’s about more than anything else, what being a cofounder really means, is signing up for this years long grind on execution and you can’t outsource this.

### Super Important

- The way to have a company that executes well is you have to execute well yourself.
- Every thing at a startup gets modeled after the founders. Whatever the founders do becomes the culture. So if you want a culture where people work hard, pay attention to detail, manage the customers, are frugal, you have to do it yourself.

- There is no other way. You cannot hire a COO ( chief operating officer ) to do that while you go off to conferences. The company just needs to see you as this maniacal execution machine. 

- There’s at least a hundred times more people with great ideas than people who are willing to put in the effort to execute them well. Ideas by themselves are not worth anything, only executing well is what adds and creates value.

### 5 Main jobs of CEO

- Set the vision
- Raise money
- Evangilize (recuriting, running,  press )
- Hire and manage
- Make sure the entire company execute

### Focus

  So can you get done it????
  
There will be a lot of things to done but you can done only 2 or 3 

**where are you spending time and money?**

**what are the two imporant things to do?**

You must need to done otherwise it can be very difficult.

> if you don't get good at setting what those two or three things are, you'll never be good at getting stuff done. This is really hard for founders. Founders get excited about starting new things.

So then there's this question of how do you figure out what to focus on each day. 
**Each day it's really important to have goals.** Most good founders have a set of small overarching goals for the company that everybody in the company knows.
You know it could be something like 
 - ship a product by this date, 
 - get this certain growth rate, 
 - get this engagement rate, 
 - hire for these key roles, 
 - those are some of them but everyone in the company can tell you each week what are our key goals. 
 And then everybody executes based off of that.

### Care About

1. Saya a lot
2. Set the goals 
3. Commnuicate
4. Maintian growth & momentum
5. Work together in person 

**Success of Startup is with extreme Focus and dedication.** 

> You can have a startup and one other thing, you can have a family, but you probably can't have many other things. Startups are not the best choice for work life balance and that's sort of just the sad reality. There's a lot of great things about a startup, but this is not one of them. Startups are all-consuming in a way that is generally difficult to explain. You basically need to be willing to outwork your competitors.

### Intensity

- Releteness operating rythm ( move fast and break things like fb or google ) 
- Obsession with execution quality
- Bias towards action ( do not just talk, just do quickly ) 
- Quickly 
- Do whatever it takes 
- Do not give up
- Show up
- Be courageous
- Move speedly
- Future of Startup depends 


> Momentum and growth are lifeblood of Startups.

**Always keep momentum, Always keep growing**

If you cannot keep momentum and growth
fix the small one and keep momentum 
And 
   **Sales fix everything in Startup**
   
### For momentum and growth

Operating rythm 
- Shipping product
- Launching new features 
- Reviewing / reporting metrics and milestones

Do not use money which you don't have!
