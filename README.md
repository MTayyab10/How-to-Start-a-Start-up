## Four Areas for Start-up

### Why you should start Start-up?

Every one whos start start-up always says that you couldn't imagine how hard and painful it is going to be. 

You should start start-up that you can feel compelled by a particular problem and that you can think starting a company you can solve that probelm.


**Passion** should come first and **Start-up** second. 

### 1. Great Idea

It's become popular in recent years that Idea doesn't matter, you do not need to spend a lot of time on **Idea**.  
You just supposed to start, even do not think it is valube work. So this **totally wrong**. 
A bad idea is a bad
Great companies start with **great idea**. If you look successful start-ups they alawys have a good idea. 




Co-founders

Shoud be smart & have technical knowledge

( good to have 2 or 3 co-founders ) Its better not to have instead of having a bad co-founder
