# How to start a StartUp


### Note :

       Startup are different than normal companies.
  
## Four Areas for Start-up

1. Idea 
2. Product 
3. Team
4. Execution

### Why you should start Start-up?

Every one whos start start-up always says that you couldn't imagine how hard and painful it is going to be. 

You should start start-up that you can feel compelled by a particular problem and that you can think starting a company you can solve that probelm.


**Passion** should come first and **Start-up** second. 

## 1. Great Idea

It's become popular in recent years that Idea doesn't matter, you do not need to spend a lot of time on **Idea**.  

You just supposed to start, even do not think it is valube work. So this is **totally wrong**. 

A bad idea is still bad.

Most great companies start with **great idea**. If you look at successful start-ups they alawys have a good idea.

### Def of Idea
The defination of idea is very broad it includes the **size and the growth** of the market.
- The growth strategy for the company.
- The defensibility strategy and so on...
When you are evaluting an idea you need to think through all these things, not just the product.
If it works out you are going to work for **10 Years** So its worth some real upfront time to think there's a long term value in the defensibilty of busines.
Even though plans themselves are worthless the **exercise of planning** is really valuable and totally missing in most start-ups.
Long term thinking is so important in startups, that is huge advantage if you do it.
**Remember:**
        The idea will expand and become more ambitious you go. You certainly don't need to figured out in a path from here to the world donmination.

You are thinking through ideas another thing that we see young founders get wrong all the time is that someday you need to build business that's difficult to replicate ( important to remember it )

If you have several ideas that all seem pretty good work on the one which you often think about it
**TIP**
   Most founders that they wish they have waited to start a start-up until they came up with an idea they really loved.
   Another way to looking this is that the best companies are almost always mission oriented.

The company should feel like an **important mission**. It take years and years, even decades to create a great start-up.
If you do not love and believe in what are you building you will likely to give up at some point.

A lot of founders and usually students belive that their start-ups only going to take two or three years and after that they will work on what they really passionate, that almost never works out, good startups usually takes **10 Years**.\

Another advantage of mission oriented company is that outsider peoples will help and support.
**Hard Part**
     The hardest part about coming up with great ideas is that the best ideas often look very **terrible** at the beginning.
**Seems like a bad idea** Start-Up **This a good idea**.

You need to turn out your idea into monopoly but you cannot get monopoly in the big market, righ wat too much competition, For that you need to find small market in which you can get monopoly and then expand quickly.

This is why some great startup ideas look really bad in the beginning its.

**Keep in mind** There is a really hard part a great idea most people are going to think about it's a bad, you should be happy about that. Means they will not compete with you.

You are also really wanna take the time to think about how the market is going to evolve you, u need to a market that is going to be big in next 10 years.
Most Investors are obsessed with market size today, they do not think all about how the market is going to evolve.
