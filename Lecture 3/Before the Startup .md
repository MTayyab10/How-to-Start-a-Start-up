 ## Counterintuitive Parts of Startups and How to Have Ideas
 
- Startups are very counterintuitive.
- This is an area where you cannot trust your intuition all the time.
- It's like skiing in that way 
  - When you first try skiing and you want to slow down,
  - your first impulse is to lean back, just like in everything else.
  - But lean back on the skis and you fly down the hill out of control.
  **So, as I learned, part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.**
  
- Startups are as unnatural as skiing and there is a similar list of stuff you have to remember for startups. 

## List of the Counterintuitive stuff

The list of the counterintuitive stuff you have to remember to prevent your existing instincts from leading you astray.

Startups are so weird that if you follow your instincts they will lead you astray. If you remember nothing more than that, when you're about to make a mistake, you can pause before making it. 

### Questions

**Why do founders persistently ignore the partner's advice?**

That's the thing about counterintuitive ideas, they contradict your intuitions, they seem wrong, so of course your first impulse is to ignore them and, but to some extent our raison d'Ãªtre.

You don't need people to give you advice that does not surprise you. If founders' existing intuition gave them the right answers, they would not need us. 

That's why there are a lot of ski instructors, and not many running instructors; you don't see those words together, "running instructor," as much as you see "ski instructor." It's because skiing is counterintuitive.

however, trust your instincts about people. Your life so far hasn't been much like starting a startup, but all the interactions you've had with people are just like the interactions you have with people in the business world.

In fact, one of the big mistakes that founders make is to not trust their intuition about people enough. They meet someone, who seems impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings and then later when things blow up, they say, 
 **"You know I knew there was something wrong about that guy, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."**
