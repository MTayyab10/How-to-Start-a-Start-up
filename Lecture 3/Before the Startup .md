 ## Counterintuitive Parts of Startups and How to Have Ideas
 
- Startups are very counterintuitive.
- This is an area where you cannot trust your intuition all the time.
- It's like skiing in that way 
  - When you first try skiing and you want to slow down,
  - your first impulse is to lean back, just like in everything else.
  - But lean back on the skis and you fly down the hill out of control.

- **So, as I learned, part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.**
  
- Startups are as unnatural as skiing and there is a similar list of stuff you have to remember for startups. 

## List of the Counterintuitive stuff

The list of the counterintuitive stuff you have to remember to prevent your existing instincts from leading you astray.

Startups are so weird that if you follow your instincts they will lead you astray.

If you remember nothing more than that, when you're about to make a mistake, you can pause before making it. 

## Questions

#### Why do founders persistently ignore the partner's advice?**

That's the thing about counterintuitive ideas, they contradict your intuitions, they seem wrong, so of course your first impulse is to ignore them.

You don't need people to give you advice that does not surprise you. If founders' existing intuition gave them the right answers, they would not need us. 

That's why there are a lot of ski instructors, and not many running instructors; you don't see those words together, "running instructor," as much as you see "ski instructor." It's because skiing is counterintuitive.

however, trust your instincts about people. Your life so far hasn't been much like starting a startup, but all the interactions you've had with people are just like the interactions you have with people in the business world.

In fact, one of the big mistakes that founders make is to not trust their intuition about people enough.
They meet someone, who seems impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings and then later when things blow up, they say, 
 **"You know I knew there was something wrong about that guy, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."**
 
There is this specific sub-case in business. You think business is supposed to be this slightly distasteful thing.

So when you meet people who seem smart, but somehow distasteful, you think, "Okay this must be normal for business," but it's not.

Just pick people the way you would pick people if you were picking friends. This is one of those rare cases where it works to be self indulgent. 

Work with people you would generally like and respect and that you have known long enough to be sure about because there are a lot of people who are really good at seeming likable for a while. Just wait till your interests are opposed and then you'll see.

#### Another Counterintuitive point

This might come as a little bit of a disappointment, but what you need to succeed in a startup is not expertise in startups. 

That makes this class different from most other classes you take.

You take a French class, at the end of it you've learned how to speech French. You do the work.

This class can teach you about startups, but that is not what you need to know. What you need to know to succeed in a startup is not expertise in startups, what you need is expertise in your own users.

Mark Zuckerberg did not succeed at Facebook because he was an expert in startups.
**He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups because he understood his users very well.**


Characteristic mistake of young founders starting startups is to go through the motions of starting a startup.

- They come up with some plausible sounding idea,
- They raise funding to get a nice valuation, 

- then the next step is they rent a nice office and hire a bunch of their friends, until they gradually realize how completely fucked they are.

- they have neglected the one thing that is actually essential,
 - **which is to make something people want.**
 
Tthe reason young founders go though the motions of starting a startup is because that is what they have been trained to do, their whole life, up to this point.

Even in college classes most of the work you do is as artificial as running laps, and I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way, 
inevitably the work that you do to learn something is going to have some amount of fakeness to it. 

And if you measure people’s performance they will inevitably exploit the difference to the degree that what you’re measuring is largely an artifact of the fakeness.

> Since apparently the measure of success for a startup is fundraising, another noob mistake. They always want to know, what are the tricks for convincing investors? 
And we have to tell them **the best way to convince investors is to start a startup that is actually doing well, meaning growing fast, and then simply tell investors so.**
